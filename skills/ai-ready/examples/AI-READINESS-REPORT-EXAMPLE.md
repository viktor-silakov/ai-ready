## Issues Summary

- **Critical:** 1
- **Warning:** 5
- **Info:** 3

## Detailed Issues

### Critical

- [C1] **File Structure:** `src/services/userService.ts` has 1,089 lines - Too large for AI context window

### Warning

- [W1] **Agent Instructions:** CLAUDE.md exists but missing "Key Abstractions" section
- [W2] **Documentation:** ARCHITECTURE.md is missing
- [W3] **Testing:** Test coverage is 48% (target: >80%)
- [W4] **Architecture:** Circular dependency between `auth` and `user` modules
- [W5] **Context Optimization:** llms.txt is missing

### Info

- [I1] **Documentation:** CONTRIBUTING.md is missing
- [I2] **File Structure:** `src/utils/helpers.ts` is 487 lines (approaching 500 limit)
- [I3] **Agent Instructions:** Could add more NEVER rules for this project

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Split `src/services/userService.ts` into focused modules
2. Create llms.txt for AI context optimization
3. Add "Key Abstractions" section to CLAUDE.md

### Short-term Improvements
1. Create ARCHITECTURE.md with system design
2. Resolve circular dependency in auth/user modules
3. Increase test coverage to at least 70%

### Long-term Goals
1. Reach 80%+ test coverage
2. Implement ADR practice for architectural decisions
3. Add comprehensive API documentation
